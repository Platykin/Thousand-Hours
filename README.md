# Thousand-Hours
My first solo website

A website that is used as a timer for how much time you spend learning, and the arbitrary number of hours I chose is 1000.

The design will be simple, using html and css. The hard part will be the timer, cause I want it to work like a broken hourglass, pouring it's content in a glass, just like in the following image
